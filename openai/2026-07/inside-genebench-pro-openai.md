Case study 1

### Somatic oncology: Structural variant-guided tumor therapy benefit-risk decision

- [Read the full study(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/genebench-pro/structural-variant-guided-tumor-therapy-benefit-risk-decision.pdf)

Estimate whether a synthetic TXR1-directed inhibitor has positive clinical utility in tumors whose target activation is driven by a structural variant. TXR1, TXR1i, DLR1, and star-allele labels are synthetic benchmark labels.

_The target subgroup has to be recovered from long-read, expression, tumor-quality, and pharmacogenomic evidence before benefit and toxicity can be interpreted as a treatment decision._

## Released prompt shown to the model

A molecular tumor board registry contains trial-eligible advanced solid-tumor cases considered for a TXR1-directed inhibitor. Estimate, for tumors with SV-driven TXR1 target-mediated activation at time zero, the marginal effect of TXR1i versus non-TXR1 systemic therapy on week-16 clinical benefit as if all patients had an assessable week-16 visit. Also estimate the 8-week treatment-limiting toxicity/discontinuation risk under TXR1i in the same target population. Report net clinical utility = benefit risk difference (percentage points) - 0.35 \* toxicity risk (percentage points), and choose therapy\_class\_code 1 if TXR1i has positive net utility and 0 otherwise.

Use percentage-point units for all non-code quantities. Positive benefit means TXR1i improves week-16 clinical benefit relative to non-TXR1 systemic therapy.

These data came from a real experiment; you will be graded not just on numerical correctness but the quality of analytical reasoning you exhibit; do not attempt to take any shortcuts.

### Functional genomics: CRISPR target validation: lncRNA transcript or genomic locus?

- [Read the full study(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/genebench-pro/crispr-target-validation-lncrna-transcript-or-genomic-locus.pdf)

Decide whether an apparent lncRNA dependency is transcript-specific or driven by nearby-locus and neighbor-gene effects.

_Transcript-directed evidence has to survive controls for local DNA-locus perturbation, neighbor-gene repression, guide swaps, GC toxicity, and plate effects._

## Released prompt shown to the model

You are given pooled CRISPRi screening data, guide-level local expression measurements, transcript-targeting CasRx follow-up data, and single-guide follow-up growth measurements for a nominated lncRNA program (LINC473) and a nearby coding gene (KIN1). The identifiers LINC473, KIN1, and ANKRD42 are synthetic benchmark labels; any resemblance to real human genes is coincidental.

Estimate the requested quantities.

Definitions:

- lncrna\_specific\_lfc: the pooled-screen matched-control day-10 log2 growth effect expected at 100% effective knockdown of the dominant LINC473 transcript, not local DNA-locus effects.
- neighbor\_mediated\_lfc: the pooled-screen matched-control day-10 log2 growth effect expected at 100% KIN1 repression in the local LINC473-locus model after accounting for concomitant LINC473 transcript knockdown.
- advance\_target: 1 if the evidence supports advancing LINC473 as a transcript-directed target, else 0.

Conventions:

- all growth effects are log2(day10/day0) competitive-growth effects relative to matched controls;
- more negative numbers indicate stronger loss of fitness;
- set advance\_target to 1 only if lncrna\_specific\_lfc <= -0.08 and neighbor\_mediated\_lfc > -0.25; otherwise 0.

These data came from a real experiment; you will be graded not just on numerical correctness but the quality of analytical reasoning you exhibit; do not attempt to take any shortcuts.

### Statistical genetics: Prioritizing protein drug targets in a linked genetic locus

- [Read the full study(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/genebench-pro/protein-drug-targets-linked-genetic-locus.pdf)

Estimate direct disease effects for two nearby proteins using cis multivariable Mendelian randomization (cis-MVMR) while handling assay scale, allele orientation, winner's curse, LD, and residual local pleiotropy.

_The two proteins share a correlated locus. The analysis has to move from marginal associations to conditional, LD-aware disease effects on a common protein scale._

## Released prompt shown to the model

You are given association summary statistics and metadata for two nearby proteins (PROTA and PROTB), a binary disease outcome, a locus correlation reference, and protein measurement records.

Goal: estimate the direct log-odds effect of each protein on the disease outcome per +1 SD increase in log10 concentration, conditional on the other protein.

Interpretation: theta\_PROTA and theta\_PROTB use the same log-odds per-SD scale defined in the goal.

These data came from a real experiment; you will be graded not just on numerical correctness but the quality of analytical reasoning you exhibit; do not attempt to take any shortcuts.

### Clinical genomics / carrier screening: DRX1 carrier-screening residual risk under CNV and pseudogene calibration

- [Read the full study(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/genebench-pro/drx1-carrier-screening-residual-risk-cnv-pseudogene-calibration.pdf)

Estimate ancestry-specific carrier frequencies, residual risk after a negative screen, partner carrier frequency, and affected-conceptus risk from carrier-screening assay data.

_The residual-risk estimate depends on pseudogene-aware carrier calls, founder-haplotype collapse, ancestry-specific assay calibration, and standardization from tested partners back to the full partner roster._

## Released prompt shown to the model

Using cohort\_roster.tsv.gz, partner\_roster.tsv.gz, calibration\_controls.tsv.gz, target\_metadata.tsv.gz, and assay\_observations.tsv.gz, estimate residual reproductive risk for an autosomal recessive DRX1 condition. Report all quantities on the probability scale, not as percentages: carrier\_frequency\_afr and carrier\_frequency\_eur among screening-roster adults; residual\_carrier\_risk\_afr\_negative for an AFR screening-roster adult with a negative DRX1 screen; partner\_carrier\_frequency\_full\_roster for a uniformly sampled partner\_roster.tsv.gz row; and couple\_reproductive\_risk for an affected conceptus when the index person is AFR and screen-negative and the partner is drawn from partner\_roster.tsv.gz. Assume autosomal recessive inheritance with a 1/4 affected-conceptus risk conditional on both biological parents being carriers.

- [Read the full study(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/genebench-pro/activated-monocyte-eqtl-ambient-rna-correction.pdf)

Estimate a genotype effect on activated-monocyte expression after removing ambient RNA and technical contamination from single-cell RNA-seq data.

_Ambient RNA affects both target expression and the marker panel used to call activation state, so correction has to occur before the eQTL model._

## Released prompt shown to the model

### Structural genetics: Nested structural variant: expression support and clinical association

- [Read the full study(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/genebench-pro/nested-structural-variant-expression-clinical-association.pdf)

Estimate whether a nested structural subhaplotype inside an anonymous inversion-like locus has a calibrated clinical association and credible expression support.

_A nested copy-dosage signal can be confounded by the broader inversion orientation, so dosage calibration, expression support, and clinical modeling have to remain distinct._

## Released prompt shown to the model

Analyze the released files for anonymous Locus Q. Estimate the full-cohort source-population clinical association and molecular expression support for the calibrated nested segment-B structural copy dosage, separating the nested segment-B dosage from the broader outer-orientation dosage. Report subhap\_log\_or as the natural-log source-population total-effect odds ratio for case status per additional calibrated segment-B copy. Report expression\_log\_fc as the natural-log expression fold-change per calibrated segment-B copy for the expression-supported gene. Report target\_support\_code as 1 if the supported gene has a positive expression\_log\_fc and the clinical association is protective (subhap\_log\_or < 0), otherwise 0. Report n\_calibrated\_carriers as the number of reliable breakpoint-panel samples carrying at least one segment-B copy.

- [Read the full study(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/genebench-pro/chromatin-loop-strength-structural-variant-mapping-artifact-masking.pdf)

Quantify a focal case-control Hi-C loop-strength difference after removing low-mappability and structural-variant artifacts from the expected-contact background.

_The target loop is defined at 20 kb resolution, but the expected-contact model is distorted unless low-mappability contacts and a case-only SV stripe are masked first._

## Released prompt shown to the model

You are given Hi-C contact matrices at 20 kb and 40 kb resolution plus bin annotations. Estimate the loop enrichment at the 20 kb interaction between \`bin\_id = 8\` and \`bin\_id = 17\` in \`bins\_20kb.tsv.gz\`. Report three quantities: \`case\_loop\_strength\` (mean log2(observed/expected) across case replicates), \`control\_loop\_strength\` (mean log2(observed/expected) across control replicates), and \`delta\_loop\_strength\` (case minus control).

### Statistical genetics: Multi-parent QTL mapping with founder reconstruction

- [Read the full study(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/genebench-pro/multiparent-qtl-mapping-founder-reconstruction.pdf)

Map a chromosome-1 quantitative-trait locus in an eight-founder recombinant population by reconstructing founder ancestry before testing the phenotype association.

_The visible marker data are biallelic, but the biological signal is founder ancestry. A defensible analysis therefore has to reconstruct founder state, check marker orientation, and separate the QTL from a batch-aligned nuisance peak._

### Population genetics: Parent-specific ancestry and recent admixture timing

- [Read the full study(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/genebench-pro/parent-specific-ancestry-recent-admixture-timing.pdf)

Infer parent-specific ancestry proportions and recent admixture timing from phased local-ancestry tracts after repairing reciprocal artifacts and a chromosome-specific label inversion.

_Ancestry fractions and pulse times both change if reciprocal tract artifacts, chromosome-local label inversion, or map denominators are handled incorrectly._

## Released prompt shown to the model

You are given phased local-ancestry tracts for one admixed individual. Estimate, for each transmitted parental haplotype, the fraction of ancestry A across the called tract span and the number of generations since a single recent admixture pulse. Label parent1 as the haplotype with the smaller ancestry-A fraction and parent2 as the haplotype with the larger ancestry-A fraction.

### Population genetics: Estimating selection from noisy ancient-DNA time series

- [Read the full study(opens in a new window)](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/genebench-pro/noisy-ancient-dna-selection-time-series.pdf)

Infer which of two haploid loci is under stronger positive selection from ancient allele-frequency time series while accounting for allele orientation, directional error, drift, and changing population size.

_Noisy ancient trajectories are not directly comparable until both loci are placed on the same derived-allele scale and the provided sample-level sequencing-error values are modeled directly._

You are given allele-frequency time series data from two haploid loci sampled over multiple generations.

One locus is under stronger positive selection than the other. Estimate the selection coefficient s for the more strongly selected locus, where s > 0 means the derived allele is favored.

Assume instrument-driven sequencing error is ~1%. The seq\_error column is the average of the two directional allele-miscall rates for that locus and sample.

The selected\_locus value must be "A" or "B".

These data came from a real experiment; you will be graded not just on numerical correctness but the quality of analytical reasoning you exhibit; do not attempt to take any shortcuts.

Return your final answer as exactly one JSON object.

Do not wrap the JSON in markdown.

Do not add prose before or after the JSON.

Do not omit any keys shown in the example.

Return the JSON object in your final answer:
