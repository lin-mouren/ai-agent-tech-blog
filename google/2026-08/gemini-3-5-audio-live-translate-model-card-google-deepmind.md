## Intended Usage and Limitations

### Benefit and Intended Usage

- Gemini 3.5 Live Translate enables low-latency, real-time translation interactions. It processes continuous streams of audio to deliver immediate, spoken responses, creating a natural translation experience for your users.
- Gemini 3.5 Transcribe and Gemini 3.5 Transcribe Live are well-suited for users, developers, and enterprises. Some use cases include: real-time context-aware transcription, agentic voice features, and low-latency conversational agents.

### Known Limitations

- Gemini 3.5 Live Translate
  - For more information about the known limitations for Gemini 3 Pro, see the Gemini 3 Pro [model card](https://deepmind.google/models/model-cards/gemini-3-pro/).
  - Gemini 3.5 Live Translate may exhibit some of the following limitations. Voices can be inconsistent, and voices may shift after long pauses or get stuck on one voice during rapid multi-speaker sessions. Language detection can struggle with non-native accents, similar languages, or rapid language switches. Gemini 3.5 Live Translate is designed to filter out background noise, but not all background audio may be ignored. When set to echo the target language, background noise may introduce artifacts in the translated audio when input audio is in the target language.

  - For more information about the known limitations for Gemini 3 Pro, see the Gemini 3 Pro [model card](https://deepmind.google/models/model-cards/gemini-3-pro/).
  - Gemini 3.5 Transcribe and Gemini 3.5 Transcribe Live may exhibit some of the general limitations of foundation models, such as hallucinations. There may also be occasional slowness or timeout issues.
- The knowledge cutoff date is January 2025.

## Ethics and Content Safety

### Evaluation Approach

Gemini 3.5 Audio was developed in partnership with internal safety and responsibility teams. A range of evaluations and red teaming activities were conducted to help improve the model and inform decision-making. These evaluations and activities align with [Google's AI Principles](https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/) and [responsible AI approach](https://ai.google/static/documents/ai-responsibility-update-published-february-2025.pdf), as well as Google's Generative AI policies (e.g., [Gen AI Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy?e=IdentityBoqPoliciesUiAITestKitchenSSAT::Launch,-IdentityBoqPoliciesUiBardSSAT::Launch,-IdentityBoqPoliciesUiGoodallSSAT::Launch,IdentityBoqPoliciesUiAdditionalAup::Launch) and the [Gemini API Additional Terms of Service](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms)).

Evaluation types included but were not limited to:

- **Training/Development Evaluations** including automated and human evaluations carried out continuously throughout and after the model’s training, to monitor its progress and performance;
- **Human Evaluations** conducted by specialist teams across the policies and desiderata to ensure the model adheres to safety policies and desired outcomes;
- **Ethics & Safety Reviews** conducted ahead of the model’s release.

Additional information: For more information about the evaluation approach for Gemini 3.5 Live Translate, Transcribe, and Transcribe Live, see the Gemini 3 Pro [model card](https://deepmind.google/models/model-cards/gemini-3-pro/).

### Safety Policies

### Frontier Safety Assessment

Gemini 3.5 Audio is part of the Gemini 3 series of models. We evaluated Gemini 3.1 Pro and Gemini 3.7 Flash for Frontier Safety as they are the most generally capable models as of publication of this model card, and they did not reach any Tracked or Critical Capability Levels (T/CCLs) outlined in our [Frontier Safety Framework](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/strengthening-our-frontier-safety-framework/frontier-safety-framework_3-1.pdf). Our assessments have shown that none of Gemini 3.5 Translate, Gemini 3.5 Transcribe, or Gemini 3.5 Transcribe Live have meaningful new T/CCL-relevant capabilities or material increases in performance with respect to Frontier Safety compared to Gemini 3.1 Pro and Gemini 3.7 Flash, therefore we are confident that none of them are likely to reach any CCLs.

For more information on our Frontier Safety Assessment, read the [Gemini 3.1 Pro Model Card](https://deepmind.google/models/model-cards/gemini-3-1-pro/) and the [Gemini 3.7 Flash Model Card](https://deepmind.google/models/model-cards/gemini-3-7-flash/).
