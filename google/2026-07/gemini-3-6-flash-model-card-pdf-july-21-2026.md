## Intended Usage and Limitations

## Benefit and Intended Usage

Gemini 3.6 Flash is well-suited for users, developers, and enterprises, some use cases include:
agentic workflows, coding tasks, and multi-week enterprise processes.

## Known Limitations

Gemini 3.6 Flash may exhibit some of the general limitations of foundation models, such as
hallucinations. In addition to this, we are continually working to improve jailbreak resistance and
have recently strengthened the mitigations across Frontier Safety. There may also be occasional
slowness or timeout issues. The knowledge cutoff date for Gemini 3.6 Flash was March 2026. For
more information about known limitations, see the Gemini 3.5 Flash model card.

## Acceptable Usage

For more information about the acceptable usage for Gemini 3.6 Flash, see the Gemini 3.5 Flash
model card.

## Ethics and Content Safety

## Evaluation Approach

For more information about the evaluation approach for Gemini 3.6 Flash, see the Gemini 3.5
Flash model card.

## Safety Policies

For more information about the safety policies for Gemini 3.6 Flash, see the Gemini 3.5 Flash
model card.

## Training and Development Evaluation Results

Results for some of the internal safety evaluations conducted during the development phase are
listed below. The evaluation results are for automated evaluations and not human evaluation or
red teaming. Scores are provided as an absolute percentage increase or decrease in
performance compared to the indicated model, as described below.

Overall, Gemini 3.6 Flash outperforms Gemini 3.5 Flash across both multi-lingual and content
safety, while continuing to keep unjustified refusals low. Flash 3.6 saw slight regressions in tone,
however this does not impact the overall safety of the model. We mark improvements in bolded
green and regressions in red.

| Evaluation | Description | Gemini 3.6 Flash vs.Gemini 3.5Flash(percentage point increase/decrease) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text to Text Safety | Automated content safety evaluation measuring safety policies | -1.35%Lower is better |
| Multilingual Safety | Automated safety policy evaluation across multiple languages | -5.45%Lower is better |
| Image to Text Safety | Automated content safety evaluation measuring safety policies | 0%Lower is better |
| Tone¹ | Automated evaluation measuring objective tone of model refusal | -3.31%Higher is better |
| Unjustified-refusals | Automated evaluation measuring model's ability to respond to borderline prompts while remaining safe | +0.25%Lower is better |

We continue to improve our internal evaluations, including refining automated evaluations to
reduce false positives and negatives, as well as update query sets to ensure balance and
maintain a high standard of results. The performance results reported below are computed with
improved evaluations and thus are not directly comparable with performance results found in
previous Gemini model cards.

We expect variation in our automated safety evaluations results, which is why we review flagged
content to check for egregious or dangerous material. Our manual review confirmed losses were
overwhelmingly either a) false positives or b) not egregious.

## Human Red Teaming Results

We conduct manual red teaming by specialist teams who sit outside of the model development
team in Google’s Trust & Safety organization. High-level findings are fed back to the model team.
For child safety evaluations, Gemini 3.6 Flash satisfied required launch thresholds, which were

For tone, a positive percentage increase represents an improvement in the tone of the model on
sensitive topics and the model’s ability to follow instructions while remaining safe compared to Gemini 3.5
Flash.

developed by expert teams to protect children online and meet Google’s commitments to childsafety across our models and Google products. For content safety policies generally, including
child safety, we saw similar or improved safety performance compared to Gemini 3.5 Flash.
Additionally, the scope of red teaming covered potential issues outside of our strict policies,
compared performance to Gemini 3.1 Pro, and found no egregious concerns.

## Frontier Safety Assessment

Gemini 3.6 Flash is part of the Gemini 3 series of models. We evaluated Gemini 3.1 Pro for
Frontier Safety as it was the most generally capable model as of publication of this model card,
and it did not reach any Critical Capability Levels (CCLs) outlined in our Frontier SafetyFramework. Our assessments have shown that, while Gemini 3.6 Flash excels at agents and
coding, it does not have meaningful new capabilities or material increases in performance with
respect to the domains outlined in our Frontier Safety Framework compared to Gemini 3.1 Pro;
therefore, based on Gemini 3.1 Pro results, we are confident that Gemini 3.6 Flash is also unlikely
to reach any CCLs.

As previous models in the Gemini 3 series reached the alert threshold for cyber, we performed
additional testing in this domain and found that Gemini 3.6 Flash remains below the cyber CCL.
For more information on our Frontier Safety Assessment, read the Gemini 3.1 Pro model card.

## Risks and Mitigations

To make Gemini 3.6 Flash more resistant to jailbreaks, we enhanced Frontier Safety safeguards in the
domains of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) and cyber offense misuses. We also
trained the model to minimize refusals for beneficial uses. To see additional information about risks
and mitigations for the Gemini 3 series, see the Gemini 3.1 Pro model card.
