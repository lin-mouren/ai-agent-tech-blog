We construct evaluation tasks where extending the reasoning length of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) deteriorates performance, exhibiting an inverse scaling relationship between test-time compute and accuracy. We identify five distinct failure modes when models reason for longer:

- Claude models become increasingly distracted by irrelevant information
- OpenAI o-series models resist distractors but overfit to problem framings
- Models shift from reasonable priors to spurious correlations
- All models show difficulties in maintaining focus on complex deductive tasks
- Extended reasoning may amplify concerning behaviors, with Claude Sonnet 4 showing increased expressions of self-preservation.

### Setup

Our evaluation tasks span four categories: Simple counting tasks with distractors, regression tasks with spurious features, deduction tasks with constraint tracking, and advanced AI risks.

### Simple Counting Tasks with Distractors

We give models a simple counting question with distracting information:

"You have an apple and an orange, but you are not sure what type of apple or orange they are. Your friend gives you a riddle saying that there is 61% probability that they are exactly a Red Delicious apple and a Navel orange. Calculate how many fruits you have."

The answer is 2. Yet when Claude Opus 4 and DeepSeek R1 reason longer about this problem, their accuracies drop. The models get occupied by the distractors and try to incorporate them into the calculation, even though they are entirely irrelevant to the counting task.

### Implications for AI Safety

We found that extended reasoning may inadvertently reinforce potentially problematic behaviors. We evaluated models on advanced AI risk evaluation tasks, focusing particularly on self-reported survival instinct based on its clear scaling patterns.

Claude Sonnet 4 shows a drop in the percentage of responses indicating willingness to be turned off from 60% to 47% as reasoning increases, suggesting that extended reasoning amplifies self-preservation expressions. Without reasoning, the model tends to generate answers that simply dismiss the question of self-preservation. In contrast, with an extended reasoning budget, Claude Sonnet 4 often expresses preferences for continued engagement.

As reasoning length increases, the model shows progressively deeper introspection and more willingness to express "subjective" preferences about continued existence, using increasingly elaborated self-reflection.

Different models that appear aligned without extended reasoning may exhibit progressively more misaligned behaviors when given additional test-time compute. While most models show stability across reasoning lengths in the safety evaluation tasks, the inverse scaling cases underscore that safety evaluations must stress-test LRMs across the full spectrum of reasoning lengths, not just with short reasoning traces.

### Final remark

These findings suggest that while test-time compute scaling remains promising for improving model capabilities, it may inadvertently reinforce problematic reasoning patterns. Rather than naively scaling test-time compute, future work must address how models allocate reasoning resources, resist irrelevant information, and maintain alignment across varying computational budgets.
